    When PHP is executing your script, the execution can be seen as a lot of statements being executed. Most statements cause a Tick, though not necessarily all statements do so. (Manual says: Typically, condition expressions and argument expressions are not tickable.)
    <pre>

This block would normally cause 5 ticks, as you are executing 5 statements:

$a = 1;
$B = 2;
$a = 3;
$B = 4;
$a = 5;
And this block would normally cause 5 ticks, and one more tick as the end of the while loop also is counted as a statement/tick:

while ($i < 5)
    $a++;
With the help of declare(ticks=N) and register_tick_function(), you can now execute code in between the statements/ticks. The register_tick_function specifies which function should be called when a tick event occurs. And the declare sets how many tick should pass, before a tick event occurs.

With declare(ticks=1) and register_tick_function('someFunction')<span class="whitee">;</span> you will call someFunction() code in between every statement/tick.

If you use declare(ticks=3), then someFunction() will be executed on every third statement/tick.

Example:

function handler(){
    echo "x";
}
register_tick_function("handler")<span class="whitee">;</span>
$i = 0;
declare(ticks = 4) {
    while ($i < 9)
        echo ++$i;
}
This script will output: 1234x5678x9 It's that simple.
